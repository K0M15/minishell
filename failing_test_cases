env | sort | grep -v SHLVL | grep -v ^_   ---- it outputs the correct thing even tho the tester says it doesnt

cat ./test_files/infile_big | grep oi     ---- stdout & stderr working, exit code also outputs 1 like bash but the tester still says we output 134....

export GHOST=123 | env | grep GHOST        ---- stdout working, stderr there is no error beeing printed, and exit code is actually correct...
//btw  you can get the sdterr by doing 2> errors.log at the end ofc

/bin/echo 1 | grep 1                    ---- stdout working, stderr working, exit code working, tester says we output 134 agian


i tried a lot more and there must be smth wront with the tester, or idk.
