something to decide
	- use persistent history, eg. save it to file
	- how much work is it, to add input of heredoc to history?
	- could we handle readline leak if we fork the process for each input?

Parsing
	=> input handling and history
	=> parsing & tokenizing
	=> Handling quotes + braces
	=> Variable expansion

Execution
	=> Builtins X
		cd
		pwd					done		afelger
		export	need env variables
		unset	need env variables
		env		need env variables
		exit	just handle word!
		echo	with -n

	=> Redirecting
	=> Pipes
	=> execve

	=> Heredoc	(another readline with "herdoc>" prompt, listening for the delimter and saving to linkedlist or equal)
				(there could be multiple)

Runtime
	=> Variables
		get in main
		put to variable
		linked list
	=> abstraction for malloc
		2 Areas => duration of minishell, duration of single line entry or heredoc
	=> Signalhandling (Sigabort does not close shell)
		SIGING (STRG C)
		SIGQUIT (STRG \) not needed, ignored
		EXIT (STRG D)
			enter "exit", then quit
		SIGTSTP (STRG Z) ?? check if handling is need

[program] >> [FILENAME]	append to filename
<< [EOF char]	wait for [EOF char] and the pipe as input
< [fileename] 	content of files as stdin
>	put output into file
|	pipe output of on to stdin of other
