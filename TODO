something to decide
	- use persistent history, eg. save it to file
	- how much work is it, to add input of heredoc to history?
	- could we handle readline leak if we fork the process for each input?
	- cd: should we use the non directory path?
	
Parsing
	=> input handling and history 
	=> parsing & tokenizing
	=> Handling quotes + braces
	=> Variable expansion

Execution
	=> Builtins X
		cd								test needed		afelger
		pwd								test needed		afelger
		export	need env variables		test needed		afelger
		unset	need env variables		test needed		afelger
		env		need env variables		test needed		afelger
		exit	not implemented yet
		echo	with -n					test needed		afelger
	
	=> Redirecting
	=> Pipes
	=> execve
	=> Heredoc	(another readline with "herdoc>" prompt, listening for the delimter and saving to linkedlist or equal)
				(there could be multiple)

Runtime
	=> Variables
		get in main						not needed due to global environ like in description of POSIX.1
		put to variable					test needed		afelger
	=> abstraction for malloc
		2 Areas => duration of minishell, duration of single line entry or heredoc
	=> Signalhandling (Sigabort does not close shell)
		SIGINT (STRG C)					test needed		afelger
		SIGQUIT (STRG \) not needed, ignored		TODO: avoid funny empty string display...
		EXIT (STRG D)
			enter "exit", then quit => not a signal but closing stdin
		SIGTSTP (STRG Z) ?? check if handling is need				NO HANDLING NEEDED, WORKS OUT OF THE BOX 😁

[program] >> [FILENAME]	append to filename
<< [EOF char]	wait for [EOF char] and the pipe as input
< [fileename] 	content of files as stdin
